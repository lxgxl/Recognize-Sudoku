# Recognize-Sudoku
Recognize Sudoku with OpenCV
This pragram is my C++ homework project.
The developing ideas are in my blog which is http://lxgxl.me/index.php/2018/06/01/opencv-shi-bie-shu-du/

And, if you have better idea, you can push your code to my repository.
When I think of it, I will merge it to my codes.
